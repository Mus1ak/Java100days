        //variables - variables are like containers that store some entity, like for example we take a real life example , your mom asks you to store the sugar that she bought from the market to a "Dabba" or a container in general words. so here we can see that we are storing that entity ((sugar)) in a dabba or container thats what a variable is.

        //Datatypes - datatypes are just some types of data like sugar is solid, soft drink is liquid, just like that in programming terms we have integers for numbers , strings for like words we can say and so on...

        //we have basically two datatypes (Types):
        // 1. Primitive Datatypes : these are the datatypes that cannot be further divided to other smaller datatypes. like int cant be divided to other datatype.

        // 2. non-Primitive Datatypes : these are the datatypes that we can further divided to other smaller datatypes. like array it can be divided to a single int. or lets say a string it can be divided to single characters. {STRING : "S", "T", "R", "I", "N", "G"}

        //examples
        int a = 45;
        float b = 2.5f;
        double c = 23213123;
        long d = 21124214124L;
        char e = 'M';

        System.out.println("The Variables in the example were a b c d e and their respective values that i gave were :"+a+","+b+","+c+","+d+","+e);
