9# LearningJava2023

Welcome to my Java learning repository! This repository is a collection of my Java code examples and notes as I explore the world of Java development.

## Categories

The repository is organized into several categories, including:

- **Basics** : Covers fundamental concepts such as variables, control structures, and loops.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** : Explores OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **[LeetCode](https://github.com/Mus1ak/LearningJava2023/tree/master/LeetCode)** : Contains my solutions to coding challenges on LeetCode, a popular coding interview preparation website. 
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** : Includes my implementations of common data structures (e.g. linked lists, stacks, and queues) and algorithms (e.g. sorting and searching).

## Usage

Feel free to browse the categories and explore the code. You may find the code snippets helpful in your own Java development projects or simply use them as a reference to reinforce your understanding of Java.

## Contributing

If you spot any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. I welcome contributions from anyone who shares a passion for Java development!

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the many online resources that have helped me on my Java learning journey, including Kunal Kushwaha's Java Tutorials, StackOverflow, ChatGpt, and GeeksforGeeks. I hope that my repository can be a helpful resource for others as well!
